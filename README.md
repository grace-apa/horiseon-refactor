# Horiseon SEO Webpage – Refactoring for accessibility
 
## Description
 
The goal for this project was to refactor a marketing agency's webpage so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimised for search engines. I was given a starter code and a webpage which included a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page. 
 
To refactor the starter code, I made the following changes:
- Renamed the title element, ensuring it is concise and descriptive
- Ensured that all links (i.e., the menu link) is functioning correctly by adding the missing HTML id attribute.
- Ensured the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Found and renamed the HTML semantic elements – header, nav, article, aside and footer
- Changed relevant ‘class’ tags to ‘div’ tags
- Added accessible ‘Alt’ attributes to image and icon elements for better accessibility and SEO
- Reworked the CSS by consolidating repetitive CSS selectors to make it more efficient
- Reorganised CSS selectors to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
- Included comments before each element or section of the page OR commented on HTML and CSS for clarity
- Regularly add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of my webpage.


To deploy my project to GitHub pages, I followed the below instructions:
- Created a new repository on my GitHub account and cloned it to my computer.
- Regularly used the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.
- Navigated to my webpage to confirm it has gone live
- Ensured my project deploy and displays correctly 


As a developer, I’ve learnt the following best practices:
1.	It’s important that once any changes are made to HTML elements, the same is done for CSS selectors and their properties (where relevant)
2.	It is important to regularly commit my code to GitHub to prevent losing my code history and because of this I now know how to use the VS Code terminal and how to complete a Git flow with confidence.

This webpage is now more accessible as the Alt text will now be displayed in place of an image if an image or logo file cannot load. Adding Alt text will also provide better image context/descriptions to search engine users helping them to index and rank an image properly in image search. This also provides search engines with contextual information about the content on the page.
